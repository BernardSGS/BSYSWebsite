        <h4> What is BSYS ? </h4>
        <p>
             We are a Cross-disciplinary team of undergraduate Concordia students. We intend to work engineering students as well as studetns from the the field of Neuroscience and Biology.
        </p>
        <h4>What are biosignals ?</h4>
        <p>
             A new way to interface with technology using the motion and state of the body as an input. Well known examples are the Muse Headband, the Myo armband and the Open BCI. There are many many more however.
        </p>
        <h4>WHat are the types of biosignals ?</h4>
        <p>
             - Bioelectrical (Brainwaves, Heart rate, GSR) <br />
             - Mechanical (Accelerometry)  <br />
             - Acoustic (Speech, Breathing)  <br />
             - Optical (Movement tracking)  <br />
             - Thermal (Body temperature) <br />
             - Chemical (Biosensors e.g. Sweat analysis) <br />
        </p>
        <h4>Why BSYS ?</h4>
        <p>
             We are to solve the same problems we had to face.  <br /> 
             1)Lack of information and relevant classes There are no classes or abundant tutorials on these devices and biosignals in general. We will solve this issue by teaching how to use wearable devices, and how to better understand biosignals. We also plan on doing interactive workshops.  <br /> 
             2)Lack of access -- too expensive for individual experimentation ! It is very hard to come across this type hardware as they are expensive. We will provide the necessary hardware and support for free. 
            <br /> <br />
             Which brings us to our mission ? Give Concordia students the unprecedented opportunity to access and develop novel biosignal-based technology.
        </p>
        <h4>What kind of projects are you working on ?</h4>
        <p>
         Feel free to head to our project page. If you have any idea or something you want to work on, you can contact our vp projects and you will get started asap.
        <h4>Are there restrictions to membership ?</h4>
        <p>
             we welcome any student studying or interested in hardware, software, science or design related to wearable technologies. You do not need any prior knowledged on the subjects, you are welcome as long as you are as motivated as us.
        </p>
        <h4>Other questions ?</h4>
        <p>
             If you have other questions, feel free to contact us at info@bsys.ca
