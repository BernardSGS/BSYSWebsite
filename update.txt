Hello sheeple,
 Here is what I have done so far.
 The presentation for The one and only chancellor, Mr Bernard aka Lightbulb master and  monsieur le communicateur.

 I kinda stalked your linked in profiles (pictures as well)  to find out what to write.

 I also may or may not have put a few jokes in there, so if you dont like them feel 
 free to remove them.

 If I have the time I will be adding the remaining 2 persons needed ( still debating if I should put myself
 or not)


 ps. I have had multiple issues setting up my repository properly, I may or  may not have deleted the whole
 folder. Of course I had a backup. So keep me updated if I done goofed too much. The files should all be 
 intact.
